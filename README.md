# Optical-Flow-Analysis-and-Depth-Estimation-in-Image-Sequences
This repository holds a computer vision solution analyzing optical flow. It calculates spatiotemporal derivatives, employs Lucas-Kanade for flow computation, visualizes flow vectors with confidence metrics, determines epipole using RANSAC, and estimates pixel depth. Also handles motion equations for planar scenes.
